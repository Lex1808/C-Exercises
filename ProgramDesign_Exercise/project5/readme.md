1.Starting from the queue .h header of Exercise I. create a file named queueADT. h that defines the following Queue type: <br>

typedef struct queue_type *Queue; <br>

queue type is an incomplete structure type. Create a file named queueADT. c that contains the full definition of queue_type as well as definitions for all the functions in queue. h. <br>
Create a file named queueclient. c that creates two queues and performs operations on them. Be sure to provide create and destroy functions for your ADT. <br>

2.Modify Programming Project so that the items in a queue are stored in a dynamically allocated array whose length is passed to the create function. <br>
