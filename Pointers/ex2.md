Write a function named duplicate that uses dynamic storage allocation to create a copy of a string.\n 
For example, the call\n

  p = duplicate(str);\n

would allocate space for a string of the same length as str. copy the contents of str into the new string, and return a pointer to it. \n
Have duplicate return a null pointer if the memory allocation fails.
