**Exercise** \
Write the following function, assuming that the time structure contains three members: \
    1) hours, minutes, and seconds (all of type int). \
    2) struct time split_time(long total_seconds); \
total seconds is a time represented as the number of seconds since midnight. \
The function returns a structure containing the equivalent time in hours (0-23). minutes (0-59), and seconds (0-59). \

P.S.: I don't understand how to make the split_time() function return no more than 23 hours. So I added a day count to the structure.
